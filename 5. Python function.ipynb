Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.\n","Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).\n","Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\n","The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.\n","The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.\n","The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. \n","A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.\n","'''\n","\n","total = 0; # This is global variable.\n","# Function definition is here\n","def sum( arg1, arg2, arg3 ):\n","   # Add both the parameters and return them.\"\n","   total =arg1 + arg2 + arg3; # Here total is local variable.\n","   print (\"Inside the function local total : \", total)\n","   return total;\n","\n","# Now you can call sum function\n","sum( 10, 20,100 );\n","print (\"Outside the function global total : \", total) "],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Inside the function local total :  130\n","Outside the function global total :  0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
